"""Research agent — long-form, doc-type-aware, section-by-section synthesis.

Pipeline:
  1. Resolve doc_type (planner-supplied or inferred from topic)
  2. Fetch source corpus by running each planner query through web search
  3. Write the paper section-by-section (each LLM call is bounded)
  4. Save paper_content; ingest into RAG; append to insight if scoped

Review is an explicit second pass invoked by the user (review_research_paper):
a big-model reviewer reads the paper and emits per-section revision
instructions; the writer re-runs the affected sections with those
instructions appended; the new paper replaces the old.

There is no iterative critic loop. Model calls inherit the global httpx
timeout from `shared.models` (default 2400s) and the model-pool slot
queue serialises concurrent calls — research does not impose a tighter
cap on top of that.

    The earlier version of this helper wrapped `fn` in a `ThreadPoolExecutor`

    `model_call`'s own httpx timeout (set globally via `models.http_timeout_s`
    in `config.json`, default 2400s) and would fire mid-stream — orphaning
    the in-flight request and surfacing as 'all body sections failed' even
    when the model was about to return. Nothing else in the codebase wraps
    `model_call` like that, and nothing else hits these timeouts.

    `model_call` and `run_web_search` already:
      - acquire a slot from the model pool (queues if busy);
      - bound a single HTTP call with the global httpx timeout;
      - return `("", 0)` on any failure.

    So this helper just runs `fn` inline. The legacy `timeout_s` argument is
    accepted but ignored to keep the callsites unchanged — the surrounding
    `_research_timeout(...)` lookups still work, they just no longer enforce
    an outer cap.
