"""Insight producer — the home dashboard's headline artefact.

When the user has been idle for the configured window (default 2h after the
last chat/code activity) OR the fallback twice-daily window fires, the
dispatcher enqueues one ``insight_produce`` job per org. That job:

1. Picks a topic worth writing about (see :mod:`tools.insight.topic_picker`).
2. Gathers substantial source material:
   - Graph neighbourhood for the topic + related entities.
   - Chroma RAG hits across ``agent_outputs``, ``chat_knowledge``, and the
     org's digest collection.
   - Recent completed ``scrape_targets`` summaries mentioning the topic.
3. Runs a long-form synthesis prompt and produces a 800-1500 word briefing
   in markdown.
4. Writes an :mod:`shared.insights` row, surfacing it on the dashboard.
5. Posts a short assistant message into the home conversation so the user's
   feed shows the insight inline alongside their chat history.
6. (Fire-and-forget) enqueues a research plan for the same topic so the
   next cycle has fresher web-scraped material to synthesise from.

Runs as a tool-queue (Huey-backed) handler, so it inherits the existing
chat-idle back-off and priority plumbing.

_SYNTHESIS_PROMPT = """You are writing an analysis briefing for the user's home dashboard. You have access to excerpts from their own knowledge base — past conversations, research, and notes. Your job is NOT to summarise what they already know. Your job is to surface what they haven't yet seen clearly:

- Patterns across multiple threads they haven't named
- Tensions or tradeoffs they're navigating without resolving
- A gap in their current picture that would change their approach
- A decision they're circling but haven't framed

TOPIC: {topic}
ANGLE: {angle}
WHY THIS TOPIC WAS CHOSEN: {rationale}
RELATED CONTEXT (only use if source material links these to the topic — do NOT force connections): {related_entities}

SOURCE MATERIAL (excerpts from the user's knowledge base):

{material}

WRITE THE BRIEFING AS MARKDOWN. Required structure:

1. `# <title>` — name the specific tension, gap, or insight — not just the topic. Bad: "Duck Creek Overview". Good: "Duck Creek's API Depth is the Make-or-Break Decision You Haven't Made".
2. `## The bottom line` — 2-3 sentences of direct prose. State the single most important thing: a pattern, a gap, a decision. Do not restate the rationale.
3. `## What the evidence shows` — 2-3 paragraphs synthesising the source material. What do the excerpts reveal when read together? What tension or pattern emerges? Inline citations: `[source: <url or filename or graph>]`. If most material comes from a single conversation, note this and work with what you have.
4. `## The decision or gap` — 1-2 paragraphs. What specific decision point or knowledge gap does this surface? What would change for the user if they resolved it?
5. `## Next steps worth taking` — 4-6 bullets. Each is a concrete, specific action: a question to ask the system, a comparison to run, a decision to make. Phrase as imperatives ("Ask the system to compare…", "Decide whether…", "Research…").
6. `## Sources` — deduped bulleted list of cited sources.

HARD RULES:
- Target 400-700 words. Tight and useful beats long and padded.
- Only connect related entities to the topic if the source material actually links them. No invented connections.
- No "What's new" section unless the material contains dated external facts — internal chat excerpts are not "industry news".
- No fabrication of URLs, product features, prices, or events.
- No generic AI/tech commentary the user didn't bring up themselves.
- No filler phrases: "It is important to note", "In conclusion", "This analysis reveals".
- Output raw markdown only.
"""

_ACK_MESSAGE_PROMPT = """Write a 1-sentence note telling the user there's a new insight on their home dashboard.

Topic: {topic}
Why picked: {rationale}
Opening line of the insight: {lead}

Rules:
- Reference the rationale briefly (e.g. "Since we've been deep in X…").
- Name what the insight found — use the opening line as a hint.
- No markdown, no bullet points, no "I hope you find this helpful", no "I've compiled".
